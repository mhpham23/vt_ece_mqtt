------------Mosquitto MQTT-----------------------
1. Download and install Mosquitto MQTT Broker:
	https://mosquitto.org/download/
	
2. After installing Mosquitto, go to its directory and open CMD prompt

3. Navigate to mosquitto directory, look for mosquitto.conf file

4. Inside mosquitto.conf file, add 'allow_anonymous true' and 'listener 1883 0.0.0.0'

5. Type 'mosquitto -v -c mosquitto.conf' in the cmd prompt. Now the MQTT service has started.

---------------Arduino Client--------------------
1. Use the following Arduino folders for demo:
	- ldr_pub_client: Main publisher. Measure analog signal of the light sensor and publish 
	to 'light_intensity' topic
	- ldr_relay_client: Publisher and Subscriber. Subscribe to 'light_intensity' topic
	processing data and send command to turn LED ON/OFF by publishing to 'light_intensity/relay' topic
	- ldr_sub_client: Main subscriber. Subscribe to 'light_intensity/relay' topic. Control the LED according to message received
	
2. Navigate to 'arduino_secrets.h' files, put in your Network information

3. Naviagte to 'X.ino' files, change Message Time Interval as needed in the Macros section (all clients should match each other)
	Change or add TOPICS as neccessary
	
------------Circuit-----------------------------
Either lookup LDR circuit or follow the first example of the link below:
https://circuitdigest.com/microcontroller-projects/arduino-light-sensor-using-ldr

CAUTION: For the light sensor that was ordered by Dr. Jones, the short head is (PWR/+).
		For the LED light, the short head is (GND/-)
